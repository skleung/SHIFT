Agenda for CS96SI sync:
* Speaker line-up: we need about 6 speakers total:
    - "Keynote": someone who can give a fantastic overview of mobile health, the reason for its growth and why mobile technology in particular is exciting.
    - Research-Kit oriented talk: Familiar with ResearchKit and the importance of clinical research through mobile technology - we should definitely reach out to Euan Ashley's group at Stanford. Hopefully we could get Euan himself to speak about MyHeartsCount.
    - Apple Health oriented talk: Someone to talk about CareKit + Apple's specific competencies and what sort of insfrastructure/support Apple has built up specifically for healthcare.
    - Mobile Health Entrepreneur: Someone who's built a product that touches different parts of the healthcare ecosystem. I can ask Jason, my co-founder/CEO, though 
    - Google Fit/Verily: Somedone from one of these teams (ideally a Product/Engineering sort of person) to chat about the flip side of Android and what sort of affordances are there (if they could compare anc contrast the two frameworks, that'd be even better)
    - Patient advocate - someone who can give a perspective of mobile health from a patient perspective (this could be a founder/entrepreneur or some sort)
    - Investor - someone who can give an idea of what it actually takes to move these ideas forwards. Ruby Lee from KPCB Edge or Lynne Chou from KPCB proper (both Stanford alums) would be a good fit. I can also ask someone at Rock Health if they don't pan out. I'm thinking that they'd give a talk and then stay to hear the group pitches.
* Timeline for course itself:
    1. Keynote + Course Overview. First Lecture (HealthKit Part 1)
    2. Second Lecture (HealthKit Part 2). Lab
    3. Research-Kit Talk + Third Lecture (Research Kit). Lab
    4. Apple Health Talk + Fourth Lecture (Care Kit). Lab
    5. Mobile Health Entrepreneur Talk. Lab
    6. Midterm Pitches. Lab
    7. Google Fit/Verily Talk. Lab
    8. Patient Advocate. Lab
    9. Provider Talk. Lab
    10. Investor Talk. Final Presentations

* What should we do for 1 vs. 2 units.
    Option 1: At every "lab" portion, we split the class into half: one part is working on learning iOS with Bryan and I running 20-30 minute short lectures and helping them build up to a Twitter copy which we'll grade at the end of the course.
    Option 2: We get people to spend the quarter needfinding as a pilot for future needfinding focused courses. They would present to us at the end of the course. (One downside is that this sort of mirrors Mart's existing class...and she definitely has more resources to put behind this)
    Other ideas??

* There's a strong likelihood not all of our CA's projects will end up having a team. What can we do about this - maybe they can help us manage the iOS teaching part of the course? and end up learning iOS themselves?
